# Matlab MFCC
<sub> Description: MATLAB code for audio signal processing, emphasizing Real Cepstrum and MFCC feature extraction. It reads a wave file, applies Hamming and Rectangular windows, and then computes Real Cepstrum. Utilizes MATLAB's built-in functions for extracting MFCC features. Perfect for audio analysis and feature engineering. </sub>

# Introduction:
This repository contains MATLAB code for audio signal processing, primarily focusing on feature extraction techniques. The code reads a specified wave file, applies various windowing functions, and extracts Real Cepstrum and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).

# Usage:
## Open a Wave File:
```Matlab
[Y,FS,WMODE,FIDX]=readwav('f100.wav');
```

## Play the Wave File:
```Matlab
player = audioplayer(Y(1:1:72000), FS);
play(player);
```

## Windowing with Hamming Window:
```Matlab
Windowsh = 0.0125;  % Window size in seconds
fh = enframe(Y, hamming(FS * Windowsh));
```

## Windowing with Rectangular Window:
```Matlab
Windowsr = 0.00625;  % Window size in seconds
fr = enframe(Y, rectwin(FS * Windowsr));
```

## Real Cepstrum:
### On Rectangular Window:
```Matlab
Cr = rceps(fr);
```
### On Hamming Window:
```Matlab
Ch = rceps(fh);
```

## MFCC on Rectangular Window:
```Matlab
ncr = 26;  % Number of cepstral coefficients
nr = 50;   % Frame length in samples
MFCCr = melcepst(Y, FS, 'R', ncr, floor(3*log(FS)), nr);
```

## MFCC on Hamming Window:
```Matlab
nch = 39;  % Number of cepstral coefficients
nh = 100;  % Frame length in samples
MFCCh = melcepst(Y, FS, 'M', nch, floor(3*log(FS)), nh);
```
